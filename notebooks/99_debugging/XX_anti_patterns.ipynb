    "\n",
    "- **Log Levels**: Logging libraries often provide different severity levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL), allowing you to easily categorize your log messages and filter them accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Log Targets**: You can direct your log messages to various outputs like files, sockets, or even external logging services, without changing the actual logging calls in your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Log Formatting**: Logging libraries allow you to include additional data in log entries, like timestamps, line numbers, or other contextual information.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Scalability**: In production systems, logging libraries can be configured to aggregate logs from multiple services, something that is extremely hard to do with plain print statements."
