    "- It's a Database toolkit, with lots of tools\n",
    "- ORM is one of these tools, but some features don't use the ORM\n",
    "- These non-ORM features are called **SQLAlchemy Core** and contains for example:\n",
    "\t- a facade around Python [DBAPI](https://chatgpt.com/share/67542b5b-54e8-8005-84f5-ba53e896452b) (embellishment)  (see [PEP 249](https://peps.python.org/pep-0249/) too)\n",
    "\t- database schema management functions (create tables, databases, schemas)\n",
    "\t- a SQL query builder (python expressions to build objects that become SQL statements)\n",
    "\t- schema inspection utilities (e.g. pointing SQLAlchemy to a db and getting tje list of tables and constraints)\n",
    "- The second part is **SQLAlchemy ORM**, built on top of the core.\n",
